# Draw-By-Gesture
Application to draw in different colours on a digital whiteboard using fingertip tracing through various functions from cv2 and numpy libraries in python.


# To make it work:


Execute main.py


Just let the program scan the background for a couple of seconds ter the video feed starts and then move into the frame.



Fast moving finger is rejected for drawing so that it can be utilized to change colours without extra spots on canvas.
